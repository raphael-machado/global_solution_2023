Global Solution is a big project from my university (FIAP) which consists of creating a, literally, global solution linked to modern technologies and showcasing it on a website ourselves have created! :)

This time, the subject was UN's Susainable Development Goals: Goal 2 (Zero Hunger)
Me and my group created, in a short period of time, a possible solution to contribute to world hunger's reduction linked to family farming! 
Our solution is composed by the creation of a generative artifficial inteligence as a way of reducing food wasting and improving productivity. 

Give it a shot, it's really cool!

Would definitely appreciate a feedback on this one!

Kind regards,
Raphael Machado
